# It creates a pod-reader role, which has access only to the Pods of lfs158 Namespace. Once the role is created, we can bind users with RoleBinding.

# There are two kinds of RoleBindings:

# RoleBinding
# It allows us to bind users to the same namespace as a Role. We could also refer a ClusterRole in RoleBinding, which would grant permissions to Namespace resources defined in the ClusterRole within the RoleBindingâ€™s Namespace.

# ClusterRoleBinding
# It allows us to grant access to resources at a cluster-level and to all Namespaces.
